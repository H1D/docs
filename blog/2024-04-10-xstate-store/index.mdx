Does the world need another state management library? Probably not, but if you've been interested in XState, you're going to want to check this one out.

XState Store is a simple & tiny state management library largely inspired by XState. If you just need a way to update data in a store and subscribe to changes in the store, XState Store is for you. It is:

- **Extremely simple**. Provide initial context and transition functions to the `createStore(…)` function, and you're good to go.
- **Extremely small**. Less than 1kb minified and gzipped.
- **XState compatible**. Shares actor APIs with XState, making integration/migration easy if (when) you need to handle more complexity.
- **Extra type-safe**. Written in TypeScript, it provides strong event and snapshot types, _automatically_ inferred from your context and transitions.
- **Event-based**. Works just like XState; send events to trigger transitions.
- **Immer ready**. Easily add [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) for "mutable" context updates with `createStoreWithProducer(producer, …)`.

Install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xstate/store):

```bash
npm install @xstate/store
```

Create your store and use it anywhere:

```ts
import { createStore } from '@xstate/store';

const store = createStore({
  count: 0
}, {
  inc: {
    count: (context, event: { by: number }) => context.count + event.by
  }
});

store.subscribe((snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.context);
});

store.send({ type: 'inc', by: 1 });
// logs { count: 1 }
store.send({ type: 'inc', by: 2 });
// logs { count: 3 }
```

Even in React:

```tsx
import { useSelector } from '@xstate/store/react';
import { store } from './store';

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(store, (state) => state.context.count);

  return <button onClick={() => store.send({ type: 'inc', by: 1 })}>
    {count}
  </button>;
}
```

## Motivation

There are many state management libraries out there, such as XState, Redux, MobX, Zustand, Pinia, and more. They generally fall under two categories: **direct** and **indirect** state manipulation.

- Direct state manipulation is easiest, since you can directly update the state anywhere in your application, at any time. However, this can lead to bugs and unpredictable behavior, since logic is _not_ centralized, and a lot of defensive programming is required.
- Indirect state manipulation is simplest, since you can centralize all state manipulation in one place. This can be a little more verbose since you are sending/dispatching events (or "actions" in Redux lingo) to a centralized location, but it means that you have a single source of truth for your app logic. This central source makes testing, inspecting, debugging, and reusability much easier.

[XState](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate) has taken the road less traveled, and has strongly pushed for indirect state manipulation, as it can scale better for more complex application logic. However, XState has a pretty big learning curve, since it also implements state machines, statecharts, and the actor model – all of which are new (and important!) concepts for many developers. Additionally, we have seen teams use XState not only for complex state management, but also for simple data updates, where using full state machines may be overkill.

Instead of directing developers to go outside of the XState ecosystem for simple state management, we've created `@xstate/store`, which shares the same principles as XState, has identical APIs, but is much simpler and easier to use. If you need to scale up to more complex state management, you can easily migrate to XState.

In summary, if you just need a way to update data in a store and subscribe to changes in a store and share that data with other parts of your application, use `@xstate/store`. If you need more complex state management, including finite states, effects (actions, invoked/spawned actors), use XState.

| Feature | `@xstate/store` | `xstate` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finite states | ❌ | ✅ |
| Context | ✅ | ✅ |
| Events | ✅ | ✅ |
| Transitions | ✅ | ✅ |
| Guards | ❌ | ✅ |
| Effects | ❌ | ✅ |
| Actor model | ❌ | ✅ |

## Super simple example

This is a contrived example to demonstrate the API.

```ts
import { createStore } from '@xstate/store';

// 1. Create a store
export const donutStore = createStore(
  // Initial context data
  { donuts: 0, favoriteFlavor: 'chocolate' },

  // Transitions
  {
    addDonut: {
      donuts: (context) => context.donuts + 1
    },
    changeFlavor: {
      favoriteFlavor: (context, event: { flavor: string }) => event.flavor
    },
    eatAllDonuts: {
      donuts: 0
    }
  }
);

console.log(store.getSnapshot());
// {
//   status: 'active',
//   context: {
//     donuts: 0,
//     favoriteFlavor: 'chocolate'
//   }
// }

// 2. Subscribe to the store
store.subscribe((snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.context);
});

// 3. Send events
store.send({ type: 'addDonut' });
// logs { donuts: 1, favoriteFlavor: 'chocolate' }

store.send({
  type: 'changeFlavor',
  flavor: 'strawberry' // Strongly-typed!
});
// logs { donuts; 1, favoriteFlavor: 'strawberry' }
```

Overall, the API is:

1. Create a store using `createStore(initialContext, transitions)`.
2. Subscribe to updates from that store using `store.subscribe(callback)`.
3. Send events to trigger transitions using `store.send(event)`.
4. (Optional) Use `store.getSnapshot()` to get the current snapshot of the store.

## Superpowers

We've packed a few nice features into `@xstate/store` to make state management as smooth sailing as possible. ⛵️

First and foremost, you get **strong types** out of the box for both the state context _and_ events, without having to write any awkward generic type parameters. Of course, intellisense works well for events in `store.send({ … })`. Note that to make this magic work, TypeScript version 5.4 or higher is required.

```ts
import { createStore } from '@xstate/store';

const store = createStore({
  count: 0
}, {
  inc: {
    count: (context, event: { by: number }) => context.count + event.by
  }
});

store.send({
  type: 'inc', // Strongly-typed!
  by: 1 // Also strongly-typed!
});

// @ts-expect-error
store.send({ type: 'unknownEvent' });
```

Secondly, there are convenient ways to update `context` in a transition, similar to how you would do it with `assign(…)` in XState. You can:

- Use an object to update specific `context` properties:
  ```ts
  const store = createStore({
    count: 0
  }, {
    inc: {
      count: (context, event: { by: number }) => context.count + event.by
    }
  });
  ```
- Use an object to update `context` properties to static values:
  ```ts
  const store = createStore({
    count: 0
  }, {
    reset: {
      count: 0 // No function needed
    }
  });
  ```
- Use a function to update the entire `context` (can be a partial or full update):
  ```ts
  const store = createStore({
    count: 0,
    greeting: 'Hello'
  }, {
    adios: (context) => ({ greeting: 'Goodbye' }) // Merged with { count }
  });
  ```

But if you want to make complex `context` updates even easier, you can easily use [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) by plugging in its `producer` function to `createStoreWithProducer(producer, …)`:

```ts
import { createStoreWithProducer } from '@xstate/store';
// highlight-next-line
import { produce } from 'immer';

const store = createStoreWithProducer(
  // highlight-next-line
  produce,
  {
    todos: []
  }, {
    addTodo: (context, event: { todo: string }) => {
      // highlight-next-line
      context.todos.push(event.todo);
    }
  });
```

## Comparison

XState Store does not claim to be a replacement for any other state management library. The decision for which library to use should be based on your requirements and your team's preferences. Here's a quick comparison of `@xstate/store` with other popular state management libraries, for reference only.

:::info

This is not an exhaustive comparison. It references examples from [the Zustand documentation](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/comparison).

:::

### XState Store

```ts
import { createStore } from 'xstate';

const store = createStore({
  count: 0
}, {
  increment: {
    count: (context, event: { qty: number }) => context.count + event.qty
  },
  decrement: {
    count: (context, event: { qty: number }) => context.count - event.qty
  }
});

// Use the `useSelector(…)` hook to subscribe to the store in React components
```

### Zustand

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type State = {
  count: number
}

type Actions = {
  increment: (qty: number) => void
  decrement: (qty: number) => void
}

const useCountStore = create<State & Actions>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: (qty: number) => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + qty })),
  decrement: (qty: number) => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - qty })),
}));
```

### Redux Toolkit

```ts
import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const countSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'count',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    incremented: (state, qty: number) => {
      state.value += qty
    },
    decremented: (state, qty: number) => {
      state.value -= qty
    },
  },
})

const countStore = configureStore({ reducer: countSlice.reducer })
```
