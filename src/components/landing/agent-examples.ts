// Actors are built "from" some type of logic (the actor's logical model/brain/blueprint). 
// This describes how the actor should change behavior when receiving an event. 
// Actor logic can be scaffolded from general types like \`fromMachine()\` and \`fromPromise()\`
// or more specific ones like \`fromChat()\`.
